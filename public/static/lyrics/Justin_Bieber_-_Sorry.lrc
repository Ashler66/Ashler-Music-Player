[00:09.85]You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
[00:14.56]You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
[00:19.21]I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
[00:23.58]Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
[00:29.07]I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
[00:33.79]By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
[00:38.51]So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
[00:42.60]Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
[00:47.92]Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
[00:52.49]Cause I'm missing more than just your body
[00:58.26]Is it too late now to say sorry?
[01:01.92]Yeah I know that I let you down
[01:04.93]Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[01:24.00]Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
[01:28.03]♪
[01:31.34]I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
[01:36.02]But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
[01:41.07]I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
[01:45.11]Can we both say the words and forget this?
[01:50.93]Is it too late now to say sorry?
[01:54.82]Cause I'm missing more than just your body
[02:00.83]Is it too late now to say sorry?
[02:04.31]Yeah I know that I let you down
[02:07.34]Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
[02:10.38]I'm not just trying to get you back on me
[02:14.00]Cause I'm missing more than just your body
[02:19.99]Is it too late now to say sorry?
[02:23.68]Yeah I know that I let you down
[02:26.45]Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
