[00:16.45]Lucky you were born that far away so
[00:19.06]We could both make fun of distance
[00:21.01]Lucky that I love a foreign land for
[00:23.58]The lucky fact of your existence
[00:25.67]Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
[00:27.89]To count the freckles on your body
[00:30.11]Never could imagine there were only
[00:32.40]Ten million ways to love somebody
[00:34.33]Le-do-lo-le-lo-le, le-do-lo-le-lo-le
[00:38.69]Can't you see? I'm at your feet
[00:43.46]Whenever, wherever
[00:45.82]We're meant to be together
[00:47.83]I'll be there, and you'll be near
[00:50.15]And that's the deal, my dear
[00:52.30]There over, hereunder
[00:54.51]You'll never have to wonder
[00:56.74]We can always play by ear
[00:59.10]But that's the deal, my dear
[01:02.44]♪
[01:12.04]Lucky that my lips not only mumble
[01:14.62]They spill kisses like a fountain
[01:16.77]Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
[01:19.11]So you don't confuse 'em with mountains
[01:21.23]Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
[01:23.72]To run for cover when I need it
[01:25.63]And these two eyes that for no other
[01:28.11]The day you leave, will cry a river
[01:30.14]Le-do-lo-le-lo-le, le-do-lo-le-lo-le
[01:34.28]At your feet, I'm at your feet
[01:39.10]Whenever, wherever
[01:41.48]We're meant to be together
[01:43.58]I'll be there, and you'll be near
[01:45.95]And that's the deal, my dear
[01:48.14]There over, hereunder
[01:50.49]Or up above, don't wonder
[01:52.54]We can always play by ear
[01:54.91]But that's the deal, my dear
[01:58.38]♪
[02:05.89]Le-do-lo-le-lo-le, le-do-lo-le-lo-le
[02:10.26]Think out loud, say it again
[02:14.63]Le-do-lo-le-lo-le-lo-le
[02:17.12]Tell me one more time
[02:19.15]That you'll live lost in my eyes
[02:23.36]♪
[02:25.88]Whenever, wherever
[02:28.44]We're meant to be together
[02:30.38]I'll be there, and you'll be near
[02:32.74]And that's the deal, my dear
[02:34.94]There over, hereunder
[02:37.20]You got me head over heels
[02:39.49]There's nothing left to fear
[02:41.65]If you really feel the way I feel
[02:43.94]Whenever, wherever
[02:46.11]We're meant to be together
[02:48.03]I'll be there, and you'll be near
[02:51.26]And that's the deal, my dear
[02:52.85]There over, hereunder
[02:54.85]You got me head over heels
[02:57.30]There's nothing left to fear
[02:59.46]If you really feel the way I feel
[03:01.41]♪
