[00:03.15]Ooh
[00:06.30]Na-na, yeah
[00:09.56]I saw you dancing in a crowded room (uh)
[00:13.80]You look so happy when I'm not with you
[00:17.69]But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
[00:21.86]A single teardrop falling from your eye
[00:26.48]I don't know why I run away
[00:32.02]♪
[00:34.47]I make you cry when I run away
[00:39.87]♪
[00:42.12]You could've asked me why I broke your heart
[00:46.22]You could've told me that you fell apart
[00:50.27]But you walked past me like I wasn't there
[00:54.36]And just pretended like you didn't care
[00:58.84]I don't know why I run away
[01:04.69]♪
[01:07.06]I make you cry when I run away
[01:14.81]Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
[01:18.96]Save your tears for another
[01:22.08]Save your tears for another day
[01:27.48]♪
[01:30.26]Save your tears for another day (so)
[01:39.25]I made you think that I would always stay
[01:43.23]I said some things that I should never say
[01:47.24]Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
[01:51.30]And now you won't love me for a second time
[01:55.98]I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
[02:03.64]Said, I make you cry when I run away
[02:09.25]♪
[02:11.69]Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
[02:15.83]Save your tears for another
[02:19.88]I realize that I'm much too late
[02:23.91]And you deserve someone better
[02:27.16]Save your tears for another day (oh yeah)
[02:35.35]Save your tears for another day (yeah)
[02:44.86]I don't know why I run away
[02:50.08]♪
[02:52.52]I'll make you cry when I run away
[02:59.65]Save your tears for another day
[03:05.53]Ooh, girl, I said (ah)
[03:07.92]Save your tears for another day (ah)
[03:16.14]Save your tears for another day (ah)
[03:24.00]Save your tears for another day (ah)
[03:30.17]♪
